# free-active-autodiscover-list

Regarding the vulnerability in the autodiscover process discovered by the security researchers of Guardicore, a list of active autodiscover.TLD domains is very exciting from our point of view. To find out which autodiscover.TLD domains are currently active, we used the free-dns-enum script to perform a DNS test with the TLD lists contained in free-dns-enum. The list created with this is therefore only a snapshot and is incomplete. However, a first impression can be gained with it. Many thanks to Guardicore for pointing out the problem with autodiscover.

I ran the scan again with the super list "tlds.txt" from https://github.com/rbsec/dnscan and merged the search results.
